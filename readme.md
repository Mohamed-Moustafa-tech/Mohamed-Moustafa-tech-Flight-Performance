# (Flight Performance)
## by (Mohamed Abdrabbou)


## Dataset

> This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008. I downloaded it from bureau of Transportation Statistics website. I will be investigating the last 3 years 2006, 2007 and 2008. I wrangeled the data from the website of the American bureau association 


## Summary of Findings

>  It is confirmed again that weather contributes to delays along with the aircraft delays. And counterintuitively delays for security reason is the lowest causing factor. So overall, the different layers of analysis support that weather conditions is the main player in delays and cancellations for flights.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> It is evidently observed that weather related cancellations were the most common type to cause flight performance disruptions. Additionally, the same happens with delays as the most causing factor for delays was weather conditions whereas the lowest was security reasons. The data showed that both arrival and departure delays have a linear relation which makes sense since they both under the same effect.
